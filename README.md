# Physics Engine

An implementation in C of a physics engine from scratch as a team project for 2024 CS 3. Implemented forces (gravity, springs, etc), collision handling, efficient memory handling, and input management. Used unit tests to ensure that code works. Created simulation and game demos like N-Body Simulation, Frogger, Pacman, Space Invaders, and more. Tech stack includes C, Github, Emscripten, and SDL2.
